###  Lessons Learned

The team was able to use this project as an opportunity to develop both their productive interaction skills on group projects as well as gain experience with remote communication and separated development cooperation. With the outbreak of Covid-19 the team was forced to create this application without ever physically interacting. Despite that they were able to adapt to the conditions as well as each other in order to meet their set goals and produce an application they are proud of.
